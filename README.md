# YOLOv5 Object Detection and Annotation Documentation
This document provides an overview and documentation for the Python code that performs object detection and annotation using the YOLOv5 model. The code is structured to handle training on a custom dataset, running inference on both training and test sets, and generating a submission file for evaluation.

# Environment Setup

The code assumes a Kaggle Python environment with the necessary packages installed. It uses TensorFlow for deep learning operations.

# Input Data
The input data consists of image files and corresponding annotations in CSV format. The YOLOv5 model is trained to detect and classify objects in the images.

# YOLOv5 Model
The YOLOv5 model is loaded from a TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) file, specified by the model_path variable.

# Dataset Loading
Training and test datasets are loaded from CSV files (train.csv and test.csv). The file paths are constructed based on the dataset location.

# Label Mapping
A dictionary (label_mapping) is created to map object labels to numerical identifiers. This mapping is used during preprocessing.

# Preprocessing
Images are preprocessed using the preprocess_image function, which involves resizing and converting images to arrays.

# Inference Loop
The code runs inference on the training set, collecting results for evaluation. It uses a TFLite interpreter to make predictions on each image.

# Annotation Processing
Annotations from the dataset are processed, and YOLOv5 annotations are generated based on bounding box information. The result is a list of YOLO-formatted annotations for each image.

# Inference on Test Set
The code repeats the inference process on the test set to generate predictions for unseen data.

# Saving Model
The trained YOLOv5 model and its weights are saved for future use.


Submission File
The final step involves creating a submission file for evaluation. The predictions on the test set are formatted and saved in a CSV file (submission3.csv).

This documentation provides a high-level overview of the code's functionality. For detailed implementation, refer to the code comments and inline documentation for specific functions and processes.
